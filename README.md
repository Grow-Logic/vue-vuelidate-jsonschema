> Create vuelidate validation rules based on json schema

Use the json schemas you already have for validating your api input to generate validation rules for vuelidate. And use default values to generate the data attributes.

The goal is that if your vuelidate validation is valid then you will also pass validation against the json schema. So you can with confidence serialize your model to json and the server will accept it if it validates agains the same schema.

```bash
npm install vue-vuelidate-jsonschema
```

Install plugin

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueVuelidateJsonschema from 'vue-vuelidate-jsonschema'
import Vuelidate from 'vuelidate'

vue.use(Vuelidate)
Vue.use(VueVuelidateJsonschema)
```

## Example
```js
export default {
  schema: {
    type: 'object'
    properties: {
      name: {
        type: 'string',
        pattern: '^\\w+\s\\w+$',
        default: 'Jack'
      },
      username: {
        type: 'string',
        minLength: 5
      },
      age: {
        type: 'integer',
        default: 20,
        minimum: 18,
        maximum: 30
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Is functionally equal to:

```js
import {minLength, required} from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'
import {pattern} from 'vue-vuelidate-jsonschema'

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: 'Jack',
      username: '',
      age: 20
    }
  },
  validations: {
    name: {
      pattern: pattern('^\\w+\s\\w+$')
    },
    username: {
      required,
      minLength: minLength(5)
    },
    age: {
      between: between(18, 30)
    }
  }
}
```


## Supported json schema validation rules

- type
- required
- minLength
- maxLength
- minItems
- maxItems
- minimum
- maximum
- pattern
- enum
- const
- items
- uniqueItems

The plan is to support all rules. PR's are welcome. When matching validation rules are present in vuelidate, those are used. For other validations this library have quite a few of its own.

### items and $each validation

All versions of the items property is supported.

#### single schema and non object

```js
{
  type: 'array',
  items: {
    type: 'number',
    minimum: 3
  }
}
```

If the numbers in the array are not minimum 3 or any non numbers are in the array then the array is invalid.

#### multiple schemas

```js
{
  type: 'array',
  items: [{
    type: 'number',
    minimum: 3
  }, {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      name: {
        type: 'string',
        minLength: 3
      }
    },
    required: ['name']
  }]
}
```

If the items in the array are not either a number with minimum value of 3 or an object with name and minLength of 3 then the array is invalid.

We can't expose any errors on the object itself if present, due to vuelidates limitation with the use of the $each keyword that requires all objects to be the same. Se next section.

#### single schema and type object

```js
{
  type: 'array',
  items: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      name: {
        type: 'string',
        minLength: 3
      }
    },
    required: ['name']
  }
}
```

Now we can utilize vuelidates $each property so that you can get proper error messages for properties on the objects in the array.


### Required property in json schema context

The required property on in json schema only means that the property should be present. Meaning any value that matches the type or types. So adding the property to the required array does not apply the required validator in vuelidate. It adds a custom validator that only checks if the value is not undefined. A type validator is added that kicks in if the value is not undefined.

### uniqueItems

Using uniqueItems in a json schema context means that the values are equal in terms of similarity. So an array with two similar objects violates the uniqueItems rule even though they are unique in terms of javascript object identity.

## Between validator

If both the minimum and maximum properties are present the between validator in vuelidate is used.

## Override or extend validation

You can override, extend or delete the validation rules on your vue vm like this:

```js
export default {
  schema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      name: {
        type: 'string',
        minLength: 5,
        maxLength: 30
      }
    }
  },
  validations: {
    name: {
      minLength: minLength(2), //overrides minLength 5
      email, // adds email validator
      maxLength: undefined // removes maxlength validator
    }
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that for instance json schema minLength validator adds both minLength and required validator. So you need to remove both if that is what you want.

This merging of validation options works by adding a custom merge strategy for vue options that merges them correctly.

This works also if your validations property is a function.

## Multiple schemas

You can define multiple schemas that all adds their validation rules. Simply define **schema** as an array.

```js
export default {
  schema: [{
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      prop1: {
        type: 'string'
      },
      conflict: {
        type: 'string',
        minLength: 3,
        maxLength: 5
      }
    }
  }, {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      prop2: {
        type: 'string'
      },
      conflict: {
        type: 'string',
        maxLength: 10
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

This will add data/validation for prop1, prop2 and conflict. The later definition of **conflict** will be merged into the other definition.

In the above example, the conflict property will still have the minLength validator. But also a maxLength validator of 10.


## Custom mount point

By default the schemas are added to the root data/validation structure. To attach them deeper down in the structure you can define a mount point:

```js
export default {
  schema: [{
    mountPoint: 'deep.nested.structure',
    schema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        prop1: {
          type: 'string'
        }
      }
    }
  }, {
    mountPoint: 'other.deep.stucture',
    schema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        prop2: {
          type: 'string'
        }
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

This exposes prop1 at **vm.deep.nested.structure.prop1** and prop2 at **vm.other.deep.stucture.prop2**


## vuelidate error extractor

I recommend to use [vuelidate-error-extractor](https://github.com/dobromir-hristov/vuelidate-error-extractor) to display error messages. This takes the pain out of the manual labor of writing validation messages for each property and rule.

## Roadmap

- [ ] support all json schema validation properties
- [ ] support loading of remote schemas
- [ ] support $ref inside schemas
- [ ] export own validators
- [ ] more tests for really complex schemas
- [x] document and test mounting procedure (multiple schemas in one vm)
- [ ] better validation params for array items validation (when not object)
- [ ] document exactly what validators are used for any json schema validation property
- [ ] pass title, description etc to the validator as params (possibly whole property schema)


PRs are welcome.
